## Description
Develop, document, and demonstrate a digital canvas alternative for standard framed canvas wall art.  I believe a breakthrough in the use of digital wall art could be made if a low cost, easy to use, open source digital canvas was available.  On the surface, this may not seem to push the limits of technology.  However, I do not think it will be all that easy to do this in an elegant manner.       
 
Project Goals

1  cost of digital canvas similar to quality custom framed canvas

2  digital canvas will hang (with wire) just like a standard framed canvas

3  digital canvas operates from power button

3.1  no remote
	
3.2  no keyboard
	
3.3  no mouse
	
3.4  full screen artwork with nothing else ever showing (kiosk mode)
     
4  open source hardware

5  open source software

 

HARDWARE

1  raspberry pi

1.1  open source
  
1.2  low cost (about $50 with SD card plus USB cable)
  
1.3 	can be powered from HDTV USB connector


2  VIZIO HDTV 39 inch - 1080p (1920 x 1080 pix)

2.1  not open source (standard electronics)

2.2  reasonable size canvas (34 x 19 inches )
 	
2.3  reasonable cost (about $300 US - refurbished)
 	
2.4  HDMI connector next to USB connector (power for raspberry pi)
 	
 2.5  recessed area to mount raspberry pi (allows flush wall mount)
      	 
SOFTWARE

1  raspbian operating system (recommended os)

1.1  open source

2  chromium browser

2.1  open source
 	
2.2  allows use of popular web programming tools
	
2.3  familiar GUI and easy to use
      			      	
3  javascript / HTML5 canvas

3.1  open source
 	
3.2  many people already know and use
 	
3.3  easy to learn and can be used for other tasks

               						
4  software alternatives considered

4.1  iceweasel browser (firefox)

4.2  worked (with R-kiosk addon)
	  
4.3  R-kiosk addon severely impacts development work
	  
4.4  runs 3x slower than chromium on my artwork code 
	
5  python (raspberry pi “default” language)

5.1  limited graphics capability
		
6  processing (excellent for artwork)

6.1  unable to get it running on my system

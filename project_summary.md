# Project Title
DigitalCanvas

## Description
Develop, document, and demonstrate a digital canvas alternative for a standard framed canvas used for wall art.  I believe a breakthrough in the use of digital wall art could be made if a low cost, easy to use, open source digital canvas was available.  On the surface, this may not seem to push the limits of technology.  However, I do not think it will be all that easy to do this in an elegant manner.       
 
Project Goals

1  cost of digital canvas similar to quality custom framed canvas

2  digital canvas will hang (with wire) just like a standard framed canvas

3  digital canvas operates from power button
3.1  no remote
3.2  no keyboard
3.3  no mouse  
3.4  full screen artwork with nothing else ever showing (kiosk mode)
     
4  open source hardware

5  open source software
 

HARDWARE

raspberry pi
  open source
  low cost (about $50 with SD card & USB cable)
 	can be powered from HDTV USB connector


39 inch VIZIO HDTV 1080p (1920 x 1080 pix)
  not open source (standard electronics)
 	reasonable size canvas (34 x 19 inches )
 	reasonable cost (about $300 US - refurbished)
 	HDMI connector next to USB connector (power for raspberry pi)
 	recessed area to mount raspberry pi (allows flush wall mount)
      	 
SOFTWARE

raspbian operating system (recommended os)  
  open source

chromium browser
 	open source
	allows use of popular web programming tools
	familiar GUI and easy to use
      			      	
javascript / HTML5 canvas
 	open source
 	many people already know and use             	
 	easy to learn and can be used for other tasks

               						
software alternatives considered

	iceweasel browser (firefox)
	  worked (with R-kiosk addon)
	  R-kiosk addon severely impacts development work
	  runs 3x slower than chromium on my artwork code 
	
	python (raspberry pi “default” language)
	  limited graphics capability
		
  processing (excellent for artwork)
	  unable to get it running on my system

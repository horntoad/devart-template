DigitalCanvas

## Authors
Mahorney, John, horntoad

## Description
Phase one - develop a DigitalCanvas for wall art and demonstrate with some digital art. DigitalCanvas could be hung on wall and run 24/7 until hardware failure. Power switch is the only control available.

Phase two - add sensors to DigitalCanvas so that digital artwork can interact with its surroundings.


PHASE ONE PROJECT GOALS

1 material cost no more than quality custom framed canvas

2 will hang with wire (no wall plate)

3 will operate with power switch (no remote, keyboard, mouse)

4 nothing ever on screen but art (except at power on)

5 no "screen burn in" 


PHASE ONE HARDWARE

1 raspberry pi

2 HDTV 1080p (canvas size = 34 x 19 inches)
		
3 reasonable cost (about $400 US)
		
4 USB connector on HDTV to power raspberry pi
		
5 recessed area to mount raspberry pi (allows flush wall mount)


PHASE ONE SOFTWARE

1 raspbian operating system

2 chromium browser

3 HTML 5 canvas

4 javascript


PHASE TWO GOALS

1 choose stimulus for artwork interaction with its surroundings

2 develop hardware for stimulus

3 develop interactive artwork software


PHASE TWO HARDWARE

1 to be determined


PHASE TWO SOFTWARE

1 modify artwork code developed in phase one
